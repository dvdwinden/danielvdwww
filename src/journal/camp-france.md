<h1>A residency in the Pyrenees</h1>
<span class="font-sans text-sm">July 16, 2025</span>

Recently I ran into [Simon Collison's journal](https://colly.com/journal/tag:camp%20france?ref=daniel.pizza "Simon Collison's journal"), and learned he'd traveled to the French Pyrenees—[Aulus-les-Bains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus-les-Bains "Aulus-les-Bains on Wikipedia"), to be precise—to take part in a “self-directed residency”. 

> CAMP describes itself as a “next-level residency project,” a place where artists can stay, think, work, learn and produce. Renowned musicians also come here to run workshops. It’s based in a renovated 19th-century hotel and has fixed facilities such as editing suites, recording studio, performance space, and an arts library, plus equipment that we can borrow and set up anywhere. My aim is to do lots of walking and field recording, bring things back to Camp, and see what happens.

I've thought about doing some kind of residency for quite some time; I like the idea of holing up somewhere with other creatives, sharing some work-in-progress throughout, and spending time creating in a calm, supportive environment, away from the regular day-to-day. This one in particular is focused on music and writing, so I gather a few musicians show up there for residencies. I don't play an instrument, but I can imagine packing some recording equipment and going out into the mountains.

Either way, I've signed up to spend a week with them in November, and I'll focus on my writing. I have a few ideas bubbling, let's see what's left by the time winter rolls around. 

From the CAMP website:

> The temperatures and weather in November are very similar to April (average 15°C. in the day), and there's a chance of the first snowfall of the season on the high ridges. This is the quietest time in the village - only locals remain - it's the best time of year to visit if you want the mountains to yourself.

Having the mountains to myself for a week doesn't sound bad at all.

I'll try to follow Simon's example and post a few brief updates here when the time comes.
