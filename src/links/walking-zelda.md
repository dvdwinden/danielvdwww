Craig Mod outlines his growing up with Zelda, and his discovery of Breath of the Wild, in his [Ridgeline newsletter](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline?ref=daniel.pizza "Craig Mod's Ridgeline"), forever grateful to the people who enabled him to play it as a child, and to the creators of the game, and to the mountains of Japan.
