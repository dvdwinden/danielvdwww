[Hearing Things](https://www.hearingthings.co/?ref=daniel.pizza "Hearing Things"), an independent music publication, on why they've decided to stop hosting their playlists on Spotify. The decision comes after Spotify CEO [Daniel Ek's investment in defense startup _Helsing_](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/spotifys-daniel-ek-leads-investment-in-defense-startup-helsing.html?ref=daniel.pizza "Daniel Ek's investment in defense startup Helsing") and Spotify's latest [policy change](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/modernizing-our-royalty-system?ref=hearingthings.co "Spotify's latest policy change"), denying royalties to songs with under 1,000 streams.

I've long been on the fence about Spotify. The platform has become ever more convoluted, its business decisions increasingly indefensible. From a design and user friendliness point of view, there's an exorbitant amount of friction, too. 

It seems to me there's a great big gap in the market that a forward-thinking, music-loving organisation could step into. Think... the 2025 version of [Rdio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio?ref=daniel.pizza "Rdio on Wikipedia")?
