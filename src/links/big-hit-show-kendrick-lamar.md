This 5-chapter podcast by journalist [Alex Pappademas](https://twitter.com/pappademas?ref=daniel.pizza "Alex Pappademas on Twitter") is the best podcast on music I've found in quite some time. Instead of dissecting the music beat by beat, he dives deeper into the creative process and the context in which the music was made, speaking to the collaborators that helped Kendrick make the album, as well as to the man himself. "Good Kid was the classic, DAMN. was the blockbuster, and To Pimp A Butterfly the masterpiece."
