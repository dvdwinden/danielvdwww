<a href="https://fontstand.com/?ref=daniel.pizza" title="Fontstand" target="_blank" rel="external">Fontstand</a> is becoming a cooperative. They will be “owned and governed by independent type foundries” and are committed to creating a “fair, transparent and sustainable platform for font distribution”.

I'm curious to see how this shakes out. They're running a <a href="https://typotheque.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6Sto8k1QfqxsR4a" title="font user survey" rel="external" target="_blank">Font User Survey</a> which, if you ever license fonts, you might want to fill out. 

> As part of the process we are rethinking how fonts are licensed—aiming to design something simpler, clearer, and more intuitive for users—and this is where we need your input. We would like to hear about your experiences using fonts: What works? What’s confusing or frustrating? What would you change? Your answers will help us decide how licensing works within Fontstand Cooperative.
