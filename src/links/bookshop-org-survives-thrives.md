A fascinating look behind the scenes of [Bookshop.org's](https://bookshop.org/?ref=daniel.pizza) unexpected growth. What may come across as an overnight success is (of course) the result of lots of hard, hard work (although, there is an element of 'overnight' hidden in the bookselling-boom of the pandemic).

I'm currently awaiting my Bookshop affiliate profile. I was already linking to them from my [newsletter](http://trema.website?ref=daniel.pizza), and will soon be linking to them from my website, as well.
