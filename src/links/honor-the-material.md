An older read, [tweeted by its author](https://twitter.com/asallen/status/1639763243265835008?s=20&ref=daniel.pizza) in response to a thought on the advancement of technology and personal computers, and the [in my opinion] seemingly boring solutions we design and build using them.

"Some things are easy to do and others are difficult. Move with the grain, and you can unlock amazing experiences. Cut against the grain, and you will struggle with even the most basic tasks. It's common for young designers to propose designs that are either impossible or too costly to build. It's okayâ€”you're learning the grain."
