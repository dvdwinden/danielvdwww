<a href="https://wiki.wordsoftype.com/?ref=daniel.pizza" title="Words of Type" rel="external" target="_blank">Words of Type</a> brings together the terms used in typography, illustrated and explained in multiple languages. It's a multilingual encyclopedia for typography, initiated by Lisa Huang. She noticed a lack of consistency or availability of typographic terms. In translating them, she aims to create a useful and accessible tool for everyone interested in typography. 

Here, I'm linking to her essay on its creation, available on <a href="https://fontstand.com/news/essays/do-you-speak-typography/?ref=daniel.pizza" title="Do You Speak Typography?" rel="external" target="_blank">Fontstand</a>.
