<h1><a href="{{ external_url }}">{{ title }}</a></h1>

As I was finishing up writing a talk for <a href="http://adyen.com?ref=daniel.pizza" title="Adyen" rel="external" target="_blank">Adyen's</a> Studio Day (on designing and writing with attention and intention, on quality and craft, on taste, and on AI tooling), an email arrived in my inbox. In it was the latest post by <a href="https://carly.substack.com/?ref=daniel.pizza" title="Carly Ayres" rel="external" target="_blank">Carly Ayres</a>, writer, and previous co-founder of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hawraf/?ref=daniel.pizza" rel="external" title="HAWRAF" target="_blank">HAWRAF</a>, and it reinforced the line of thinking I'd been on.

She writes about taste, speed and AI and how, while AI may lower the bar to get to a decent first draft of whatever it is you're creating, speed doesn't always indicate progress. Progress may just be movement.

> Tools produce polish, but not perspective.

I see many people writing about this at the moment. About how perspective and taste are what can set a good designer apart. About how creative constraints and thoughtful revision are key to an outcome that's _good_, and not just _finished_.
