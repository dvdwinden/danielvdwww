If you follow me on Twitter, you'll know I make no secret of my infatuation with _Better Call Saul_ (sorry!). I think it is one of the best shows the best show ever made. It is funny and dark, slow but challenging, and bold and daring. It one-upped Breaking Bad and elevated that universe to new heights. In the video above, [Thomas Flight](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThomasFlight?ref=daniel.pizza "Thomas Flight") does an excellent job explaining the why and how.
