A long summary of [Johnny Rodgers'](https://twitter.com/johnnyrodgersis?ref=daniel.pizza "Johnny Rodgers on Twitter") experience building a modern home in the woods. "It covers the 5 years from before we bought the land to after we completed the house and took residency." Inspiring read, reminiscent of the one by [Emmanuel](https://twitter.com/equartey?ref=daniel.pizza "Emmanuel Quartey on Twitter").
