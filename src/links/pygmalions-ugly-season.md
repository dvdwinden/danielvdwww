I've been a fan of Perfume Genius ever since he released [No Shape](https://open.spotify.com/album/4XUbE270OEh8WacgMyamyF?si=bplV6ADrTpeKOi0VRuoZrQ&ref=daniel.pizza "No Shape on Spotify") in 2017. His latest album, Ugly Season, is out now and accompanied by the film above. I highly recommend you listen to the album in full—start to finish, no interruptions, preferably with headphones on—because it is an experience. To me, this is his finest album yet; an album that combines and builds upon all the beautiful things he's created over the years and, at the same time, takes it to another level. The visual by Jacolby Satterwhite is mind-boggling, a mesmerising tasting platter of Ugly Season.
