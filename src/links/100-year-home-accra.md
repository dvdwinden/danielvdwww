A long read distilling two years of learning by [Emmanuel Quartey](https://twitter.com/equartey "Emmanuel Quartey on Twitter"), who designed a home for his family in Accra, Ghana. Fascinating peek at the design processâ€”one can only hope to be able to dabble with a project like this at some point in life.
