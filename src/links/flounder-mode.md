> If this is a way of living and working thatâ€™s available to all of us, why do we fetishize the white-knuckling and pain?

More of an essay _on_ than a profile _of_ [Kevin Kelly](kk.org?ref=daniel.pizza "Kevin Kelly"), written by [Brie Wolfson](https://www.briewolfson.com/?ref=daniel.pizza "Brie Wolfson"), for [Colossus Review](https://joincolossus.com/?ref=daniel.pizza "Colossus Review"). Reading the piece is like seeing Brie's eyes being opened by Kelly's way of living, working, and being. 

I wasn't so familiar with Kelly, and this has made me want to dig deeper. A fascinating and inspiring person, whose working methods I think I very much agree with.
