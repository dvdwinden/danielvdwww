My colleague Amy recommended [this podcast with Molly Mielke](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5HoFWZzo4PAzEhF5Tn3WbD?si=d6473d4330894713&ref=daniel.pizza) in which she speaks about her [thesis on computers and creativity](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc?ref=daniel.pizza), which I'm linking to here. It's a delightful read, one that makes me excited about the future of computers & computing. To quote [Molly](https://twitter.com/mollyfmielke?ref=daniel.pizza):

_“Computers have, since their inception, been a rigid tool that the human user has had to adapt to use... However, through standardization, moldability, and abstraction, we can dramatically expand the utility of computers while broadening their capacity to help more people solve their problems creatively.”_
