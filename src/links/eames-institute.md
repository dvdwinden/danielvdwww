[The Eames Institute](https://www.eamesinstitute.org/ "The Eames Institute") enlisted [Instrument](https://www.instrument.com/ "Instrument") to “co-create a digital platform to unveil their vast collection to the world”. A dream client if there ever was one, the folks at Instrument asked themselves: can a website have a soul? The answer is a resounding yes, and the accompanying [case study](https://www.instrument.com/work/eames-institute/ "Eames Institute case study on Instrument's website") documents that work beautifully.
