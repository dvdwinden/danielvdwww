The Economist app's Home tab layout will change depending on whether it's a week or weekend day, in an attempt to fix their “relatively leaky bucket” and retain subscribers.

> During the week, the app will lead with a horizontal top stories bar called “The World in Brief,” followed by the day’s latest stories and vertical videos. On the weekends, “The World in Brief” will be pushed further down and the Home tab will promote longer, in-depth stories and opinion and culture writers while a Weekly tab will highlight stories from the week’s print edition.

I'm curious if this approach will work. I seek out longer reads on weekends (in whatever news apps I'm using), but I also save them for the weekend throughout the week, and I can't admit to ever having achieved inbox zero.
