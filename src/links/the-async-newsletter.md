Lately I've been digging into methods for [asynchronous work](https://almanac.io/magazine/the-async-encyclopedia?ref=daniel.pizza "The async encyclopedia") and learning about how to implement them, because I think we (still) have a little way to go in that respect. I've found [Twist's](https://twist.com?ref=daniel.pizza "Twist") newsletter on the matter very insightful. It's not too preachy and highlights pros and cons of asynchronous (and synchronous) work in an accessible way. If you're into designing how a company (your company?) communicates, this is a good place to start.
