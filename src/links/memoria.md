Thai filmmaker [[Apichatpong Weerasethakul](https://letterboxd.com/director/apichatpong-weerasethakul/?ref=daniel.pizza) reflects on his latest movie—his first not shot in Thailand— the process of shooting it on film, and the role sound design played in its creation. I absolutely loved watching this in the cinema and highly recommend you do so, if you can.
