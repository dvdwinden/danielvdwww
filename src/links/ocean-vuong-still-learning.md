Ocean Vuong's [On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous](https://oku.club/book/on-earth-were-briefly-gorgeous-by-ocean-vuong-NYoDK?ref=daniel.pizza) is, already, one of my favourite books I've [read in 2022](/reading). It's an incredible and sensitively written book. He has now won a MacArthur "genius" grant, and spoke to The New Yorker about his approach to writing.
