The world's most popular book on art is the topic of my book club this month. I've never read it (shame on me), and had to choose between a paperback version or this large, clothbound luxury edition. Easy decision. 

> This luxury edition, with its bespoke cloth cover and preface by Professor Gombrich's granddaughter Leonie,  is the ultimate gift purchase for all art lovers â€“ a keepsake to treasure, and to inspire future generations.
