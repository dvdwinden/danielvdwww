_“I want to consider that we borrow some lessons from Le Guin and Shevek and look at ambiguity not merely as something to manage or navigate through, but as something to hold. Something to make space for.”_

This essay by [Mandy Brown](https://aworkinglibrary.com/about/?ref=daniel.pizza "Mandy Brown") about embracing ambiguity has lingered in my mind ever since I read it. In her newsletter, she wrote that the essay is more "tentative" than she's comfortable with, but I think its tentativeness strengthens the piece. As Mandy writes, and I am inclined to agree: "I'm coming around to thinking that ambiguity, like change, is a constant companion. And maybe instead of manipulating or avoiding it, we need to listen to what it has to say."
