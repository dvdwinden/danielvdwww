> The open web can be the future of publishing if we put our minds to it!

Mathew Ingram on publishing _tools_ versus publishing _platforms_, and why Substack shouldn't be seen as the future of online publishing. He also quotes from Ana Marie Cox's recent piece, [Substack Did Not See That Coming](https://newsletter.anamariecox.com/archive/substack-did-not-see-that-coming?ref=daniel.pizza "Substack Did Not See That Coming by Ana Maria Cox"), which has been lingering in the back of my mind for a while.

> Everything suspect about Substack stems from a desire to be more like a sticky destination and less like a publisher. You can ignore their posturing about free speech and just look at how they’re leaning harder and harder into audience capture and engagement. They’re offering audio, video, short-form posts, “discoverability.” They want to keep readers in their app listening, watching, interacting—anything but reading newsletters in their inbox as God intended.
