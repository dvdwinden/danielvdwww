[Dan Hollick](https://alcohollick.com/ "Dan Hollick") is writing and illustrating a “reference manual for people who design and build software”, and he just released its first chapter: [_How does a screen work?_](https://www.makingsoftware.com/chapters/how-a-screen-works?ref=daniel.pizza "How does a screen work?"). And, I appreciate him starting with the hardware before digging into the software: 

> [...] most people have no idea how a screen works. Any time you see a pixel light up, you are witnessing actual witchcraft before your eyes - light bending through electric crystals just so you can read a tweet in bed.

It reminded me of Wim Crouwel's [New Alphabet](https://www.thefoundrytypes.com/fonts/new-alphabet/?ref=daniel.pizza "Wim Crouwel's New Alphabet"), a typeface (or typographic experiment) he created in response to the technology found in a CRT monitor.

Implied in that experiment was an urge to truly understand the technology his work was created for or displayed on. It seems Dan's manual is aiming for a similar rigorousness, which is exciting!
