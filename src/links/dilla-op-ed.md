After reading Dan Charnas' book on J Dilla, I am even more convinced he belongs among the legends. This op-ed in the LA Times briefly explains why. If you're a fan of J Dilla—or The Roots, or Thundercat, or Kamasi Washington, or Erykah Badu, or...—I highly recommend you read [Dilla Time](https://oku.club/book/dilla-time-by-dan-charnas-GLFJR?ref=daniel.pizza "Dilla Time on Oku").
