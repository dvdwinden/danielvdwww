A profile of Kendrick Lamar and the moves he's made since leaving T.D.E., the label he was with since 2007. 

"It's hard to overstate the shock it caused in the rap world when Kendrick announced that he was leaving T.D.E. It was like when the Jackson 5 left Motown. When Prince left Warner Bros. When Jay-Z left Def Jam."

The last album he released on T.D.E., "Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers", is monumental, but this Big Step does feel like a clean slate, and I am so looking forward to seeing all the things he – _Pulitzer Kenny_ – will do next.
