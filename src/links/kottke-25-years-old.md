While everyone's scampering back to build and publish personal websites, let's not forget about those who never went away (although, admittedly, Jason did take a brief hiatus, which feels even briefer considering the timespan of Kottke.org).  

_“25 years is more than half of my life, spanning four decades (the 90s, 00s, 10s, and 20s) and around 40,000 posts — almost cartoonishly long for a medium optimized for impermanence.”_

Congratulations, Jason! Please, keep at it!
