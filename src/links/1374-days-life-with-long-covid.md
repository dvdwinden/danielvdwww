> Every day is filled to the brim with appointments, meds, needles, bills and pain. The brushstrokes of my illness are suffocating.

Giorgia Lupi, an information designer, on three years of long Covid. I encountered the piece because it was [nominated for a Webby](https://winners.webbyawards.com/2025/websites-and-mobile-sites/features-design/best-data-visualization/323007/1374-days-my-life-with-long-covid "Webby Nomination for Giorgia Lupi and team") for _Best Datavisualization_. What has become of her life sounds horrendous; how she has chosen to present that horror, is admirable.
