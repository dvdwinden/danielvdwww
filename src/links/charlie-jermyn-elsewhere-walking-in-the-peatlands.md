A special episode where [Charlie Jermyn](https://www.ciaolemagne.com/ "Charlie Jermyn") recites an essay he wrote for the first issue of [_TRANSCRIPT_ Magazine](http://transcriptmag.store/issue-one "TRANSCRIPT Magazine").

The reading is a written documentation of a ten hour experiment conducted in August 2021: a walk from Leiden to Amsterdam in search of creative enlightenment. Each hour is interspersed with music that reflects the landscape and circumstance he found himself in.
