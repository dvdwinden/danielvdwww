# Colophon

This website was hand-built by me. My code editor of choice is [Cursor](cursor.com "Cursor, code editor"). I use [Warp](http://warp.dev/ "Warp terminal") for any terminal shenanigans. To get things up and running I've used a simple static site generator called [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/ "Eleventy"), using the [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/ "Nunjucks") template engine. All of this is publicly available, along with a readme, via my [repository](https://github.com/dvdwinden/danielvdwww "This site's Github repository") on Github.

Headings are set in _Degular_ by Oh No Type Co. Foster Type's _Blanco_ is used for body copy.

I don't place cookies, and don't use tracking scripts. I do use some basic analytics, which can be found on Umami. The average load time of this website is X, and its page weight is Y. My Lighthouse scores are Z.
