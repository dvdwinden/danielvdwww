A room has been erected in front of an audience. It's made of concrete, its door is thick like a vault, “a kind of killing jar”. The procedure is simple: the accused (“surplus person”) is brought into the room by two guards, long poles attached to the neck so as to keep their distance. Once placed inside the room, the door is closed. Then, slowly, oxygen is extracted from the room and everyone in attendance waits, long enough for the accused to be deceased. Clean and simple. “Try all they like, the lungs learn they have no job to do.”<br />
