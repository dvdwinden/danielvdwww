Shortly before the halfway mark of this book, there's a tiny story named _Stir-Fry_. It goes as follows:

> I just threw my dinner in the bin. I knew as I was making it I was going to do that, so put in it all the things I never want to see again.

_Stir-Fry_ is followed by a delightful seven-page story named _Finishing Touch_ about throwing a little party (“I have so many glasses after all”), which I loved. After that comes _Control Knobs_, my favourite in the entire book, about the deteriorating knobs on the narrator's outdated Salton mini-kitchen. 

I don't often read books of short stories. And, as I'm sure you can tell by now, this book is not your average book of short stories, either. But, it struck a chord. It moved me. <a href="{{ external_url }}" title="Read my recommendation for Orbital by Samantha Harvey." rel="external" target="_blank">Continue reading</a> →
