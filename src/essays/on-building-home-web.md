Welcome to my first blog post! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences here.

## Why Eleventy?

I chose Eleventy because:

- **Simple**: Easy to get started
- **Flexible**: Works with multiple template languages
- **Fast**: Static site generation
- **Markdown-friendly**: Perfect for writing content

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:

1. Web development tips
2. Personal projects
3. Things I'm learning

Stay tuned for more content!
