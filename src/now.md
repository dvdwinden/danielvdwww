# Now

After wrapping up my time at Ghost, I am currently in-between jobs. This is the first time in my career that I haven't lined up a new job before leaving. I'm curious what conversations I might end up having by making myself available, first. 

I dedicated a week to relaxing, and used this time as an opportunity to think a little bit about where I'd like my career to be headed (more on that on my [homepage](/ "Go to my homepage")). 

In recent months I've gotten reacquainted with (basic) front-end development, and I've used that momentum to build myself this website, moving no-code tools aside. I've really enjoyed the process, and I feel more confident about building things myself than I ever have. A few notes on how this website is built can be found in my [Colophon](/colophon "Colophon").

In parallel, [Iris](http://iriscuppen.com "Iris Cuppen") and I have started work on the final issue of [_TRANSCRIPT_ Magazine](http://transcriptmag.com "TRANSCRIPT Magazine"), which will come out in the fall. In September we'll head to Milan for [Mag to Mag](https://magtomag.com/en "Mag to Mag festival"), _festival dei magazine indipendenti_. (There are a few copies of our [third issue](http://transcriptmag.store/issue-three "TRANSCRIPT Magazine: issue three")!

On the home-front, [Megan](https://x.com/megantronic "My partner, Megan") and I have rented a 16 mÂ² plot in a greenhouse where we can grow vegetables. We're currently building raised beds, before getting irrigation and winter crops in. It's already proving a lovely, calming respite from day-to-day life.
