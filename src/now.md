# Now

## Available for hire
After wrapping up my time at Ghost, I am currently in-between jobs. Ideally, I'd find a role in which I can contribute to a promising product (new or established) within an innovative team that values design deeply, and raises the bar for quality.

## Building again
In recent months I've gotten reacquainted with (basic) front-end development, and I've used that momentum to build myself this website, moving no-code tools aside. I've really enjoyed the process, and I feel more confident about building things myself than I have in a while. A few notes on how this website is built can be found in my [Colophon](/colophon "Colophon").

## _TRANSCRIPT_ Magazine
In parallel, [Iris](http://iriscuppen.com "Iris Cuppen") and I have started work on the fourth and final issue of [_TRANSCRIPT_ Magazine](http://transcriptmag.com "TRANSCRIPT Magazine"), which will come out in the fall. In September we'll head to Milan for [Mag to Mag](https://magtomag.com/en "Mag to Mag festival"), _festival dei magazine indipendenti_. (There are a few copies left of our [third issue](http://transcriptmag.store/issue-three "TRANSCRIPT Magazine: issue three")!)

## Greenhouse
On the home-front, [Megan](https://x.com/megantronic "My partner, Megan") and I have rented a 16 mÂ² plot in a shared greenhouse where we can grow vegetables. We're currently building raised beds, before putting in irrigation and planting crops. The greenhouse is already proving a calming respite from day-to-day life.
